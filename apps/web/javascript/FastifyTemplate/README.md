# FastifyTemplate

Template for Node.js [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) web service providing
API via OpenAPI

## Overview

The web server uses fastify as an alternative to express. It was chosen because
it can be used to automatically generate the api and schema validation from a
single point of truth which takes the form of a file shown in this directory
and called api_spec.yaml.
