  The search_criteria document defines the parameters available for searching
  for data records or collections. The search_criteria is used in the
  search_specification document.

  Individual search criteria are logically combined with an 'and' operator -
  meaning candidates must satisfy all criteria to be returned; however, text
  field combination may be controlled using the 'text_combine' parameter.
